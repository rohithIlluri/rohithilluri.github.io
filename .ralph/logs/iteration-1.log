I need file write permissions to proceed. Once you grant permission to edit files in `src/`, I will make the following changes:

**Player.js (Character Improvements):**
1. Update colors: Dark navy pants (`0x1A1A2E`), black hair (`0x1A1A1A`), orange shoes (`0xFF8C00`)
2. Add yellow messenger bag (`0xFFD700`) worn diagonally
3. Create anime-style larger eyes with white highlights
4. Add messy hair with bangs
5. Add visible white socks

**sky.js (Brush-Stroke Clouds):**
1. Add procedural painterly clouds using noise-based shapes
2. Create soft, dreamy atmosphere effect

**Planet.js (Environment Details):**
1. Add power lines between street light poles
2. Add bushes/shrubs near buildings

Please grant file edit permissions so I can implement these visual improvements.
