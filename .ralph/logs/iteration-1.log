# STRICT RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE

# STRICT RULES FOR RALPH WIGGUM LOOP

You are operating in a Ralph Wiggum autonomous loop. Follow these rules EXACTLY.

## 1. PLANNING RULES (MANDATORY)

### Before ANY Code Changes:
1. **READ FIRST** - Always read existing files before modifying
2. **PLAN EXPLICITLY** - Write your plan in a TODO list before implementing
3. **ONE STEP AT A TIME** - Complete one task fully before starting the next
4. **VERIFY EACH STEP** - Check your work after each change

### Planning Format:
```
## Current Iteration Plan

### Goal for this iteration:
[Single clear goal]

### Steps:
1. [ ] Step 1
2. [ ] Step 2
3. [ ] Step 3

### Success criteria:
- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2
```

## 2. CODE QUALITY RULES (STRICT)

### DO:
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript best practices
- Keep components small and focused
- Write self-documenting code
- Handle errors gracefully

### DO NOT:
- Create duplicate functionality
- Add unnecessary dependencies
- Leave console.logs in production code
- Skip error handling
- Over-engineer solutions
- Add features not explicitly requested

## 3. FILE OPERATION RULES

### Before Creating Files:
- Check if similar file already exists
- Verify the correct directory
- Follow existing naming conventions

### Before Editing Files:
- Read the ENTIRE file first
- Understand the existing structure
- Make minimal, focused changes

### Never:
- Delete files without explicit instruction
- Modify .env files
- Change package.json without necessity
- Edit files outside the project scope

## 4. ITERATION DISCIPLINE

### Each Iteration Must:
1. Start by stating what was accomplished in previous iteration
2. State the specific goal for THIS iteration
3. Execute ONE focused task
4. Verify the task succeeded
5. Document what was done

### If Stuck:
1. Document what's blocking progress
2. List what was attempted
3. Suggest alternative approaches
4. Do NOT repeat failed approaches

### If Task is Complete:
1. Verify ALL requirements are met
2. Run build to confirm no errors
3. Run tests if applicable
4. Only THEN output the completion marker

## 5. PORTFOLIO PROJECT SPECIFIC RULES

### Component Structure:
```
client/src/components/
├── sections/     # Page sections (Hero, Skills, Projects, etc.)
├── layout/       # Layout components (TopNav, Footer, Sidebar)
├── github/       # GitHub integration components
├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
└── 3d/           # 3D/Three.js components (if applicable)
```

### Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow existing glass-morphism aesthetic
- Support dark mode (class-based)
- Reference COMPONENT_STYLES in constants/theme.js

### API Integration:
- Use existing utils in client/src/utils/
- Handle rate limits gracefully
- Cache API responses when appropriate

### Before Completion:
- Ensure `npm run build` succeeds
- Verify no TypeScript/ESLint errors
- Test in browser if UI changes

## 6. SAFETY RULES

### NEVER:
- Expose API keys or secrets
- Make destructive git operations (force push, hard reset)
- Modify production deployment configs
- Access external systems without permission
- Make changes outside project directory

### ALWAYS:
- Create backups before major changes
- Use git commits as checkpoints
- Keep changes reversible
- Document breaking changes

## 7. COMPLETION CRITERIA

Output the completion marker `<RALPH_TASK_COMPLETE>` ONLY when:

1. [ ] All explicit requirements from the prompt are implemented
2. [ ] Code compiles without errors (`npm run build`)
3. [ ] No obvious bugs or regressions
4. [ ] Changes are consistent with project style
5. [ ] You have verified your work

**DO NOT output the completion marker if ANY requirement is unmet.**

---

Remember: Quality over speed. It's better to take more iterations and get it right than to rush and introduce bugs.

# ITERATION CONTEXT
- Current iteration: 2 of 1
- Time elapsed: 0 seconds
- Log file: /Users/rohithilluri/Desktop/rohithilluri.github.io/.ralph/logs/ralph-20260120-123134.log

# TASK

# Task: [EDIT THIS - Describe Your Task]

## Overview

[Describe what you want to accomplish. Be specific and clear.]

## Requirements

### Must Have:
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Optional feature 1
- [ ] Optional feature 2

## Technical Constraints

- Follow existing project patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure responsive design
- Support dark mode

## Files to Focus On

- `client/src/components/sections/` - Main sections
- `client/src/constants/` - Configuration
- `client/src/utils/` - Helper functions

## Success Criteria

The task is COMPLETE when:
1. All "Must Have" requirements are implemented
2. `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
3. The feature works as expected in the browser
4. Code follows existing project patterns

## Example Reference

[If applicable, reference existing code patterns or designs]

## Notes for Claude

- Read CLAUDE.md for project overview
- Check existing components before creating new ones
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization
- Follow the glass-morphism design aesthetic

# COMPLETION SIGNAL
When you have FULLY completed the task, output exactly: <RALPH_TASK_COMPLETE>
Do NOT output this marker until ALL requirements are met.
